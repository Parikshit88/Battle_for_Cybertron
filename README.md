### There is a war going on between the Autobots and the Decepticons for their planet Cybertron ⚔️💥
    
  This is a simple game in which we have used the "_conditionals_" and "_statements_" of the "__Shell__" script to side with the Autobots ![Optimus](https://github.com/Parikshit88/Battle_for_Cybertron/blob/master/Gifs/optimus-prime.gif) and try to win back Cybertron against the Evil Decepticons ![Megatron](https://github.com/Parikshit88/Battle_for_Cybertron/blob/master/Gifs/megatron(1).gif)
